Bayesian Design of Clinical Trials Using Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-event Data

PH.R -- R code for fitting piecewise proportional hazard models. 

logrank.sas -- SAS program for fitting log-rank tests.

power.sas -- sas program for computing the estimated Bayesian type I error rate and power curves after obtaining avarage hazard ratios based on all simulated datasets.

ssd.R -- R code  for sample size determination by varying the ratio between sample size and event total to obtain specified number of events in a specified interval of time on average.
