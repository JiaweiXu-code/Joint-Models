JM3.sas             -- SAS program that fits a joint model with a random intercept. A 3-component piecewise linear trajectory is assumed.

JM6.sas             -- SAS program that fits a joint model with a random intercept. A 6-component piecewise linear trajectory is assumed.

SJM3.sas            -- SAS program that fits a simplified joint model without random effects. A 3-component piecewise linear trajectory is assumed.

SJM6.sas            -- SAS program that fits a simplified joint model without random effects. A 6-component piecewise linear trajectory is assumed.

Trajectory-curves.R -- R code that computes the correct and average fitted trajectories for treated and control groups.

Note: A 5-component piecewise constant baseline hazard function is used for all joint models.
