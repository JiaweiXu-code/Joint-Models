JM6.sas             -- Fit a joint model with random intercept. A 6-component piecewise linear trajectory is assumed.

SJM3.sas            -- Fit a simplified joint model without random effects. A 3-component piecewise linear trajectory is assumed.

Trajectory-curves.R -- Compute the correct and average fitted trajectories for treated and control groups.

Note: A 5-component piecewise constant baseline hazard function is used for all joint models.
